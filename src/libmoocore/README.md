Introduction
============

This is the C library and associated command-line tools of the [**moocore** project](https://github.com/multi-objective/moocore). This README describes just this component. There is also a [`moocore` Python package][python-moocore-homepage] and a [`moocore` R package][r-moocore-homepage].


The goal of the [**moocore** project](https://github.com/multi-objective/moocore/) is to collect fast implementations of core mathematical functions and algorithms for multi-objective optimization and make them available to different programming languages via similar interfaces. These functions include:

 * Identifying and filtering dominated vectors.
 * Quality metrics such as (weighted) hypervolume, epsilon, IGD, etc.
 * Computation of the Empirical Attainment Function. The empirical attainment function (EAF) describes the probabilistic
distribution of the outcomes obtained by a stochastic algorithm in the
objective space.

Most critical functionality is implemented in C, with the R and Python packages providing convenient interfaces to the C code.

**Keywords**: empirical attainment function, summary attainment surfaces, EAF differences, multi-objective optimization, bi-objective optimization, performance measures, performance assessment


Compilation
===========

We recommend that you compile specifically for your architecture using GCC option `-march=`. The default compilation is done with:

    make nondominated

This uses the option `"-march=native"`. If your GCC version does not support `"native"`, you can give an explicit architecture:

    make nondominated march=i686

See the GCC manual for the names of the architectures supported by your version of GCC.


Command-line tools
=================

nondominated
------------

Obtain information and perform filtering operations on the nondominated sets given as input.
